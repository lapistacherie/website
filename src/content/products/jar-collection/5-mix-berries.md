Jar contains Dried Whole Cranberries and Dried Blueberries.

## Consumption and Storage:

The tartness of the cranberries is mellowed by the sweetness of blueberries, creating a harmonious medley of flavours. The dried berries can be incorporated into various dishes including baked goods, salads, and smoothie bowls, giving a tangy and sweet twist to the dishes.

Store in a cool and dry place. Refrigerate to extend the shelf life.
